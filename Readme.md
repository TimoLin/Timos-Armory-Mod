Timo's Armory Mod
=================
## Motivation  
[Inky's Armory Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1506010908&searchtext=armory) is a great Armory mod which gives me much fun, yet it hasn't updated for some time and it has bugs in V2.2. Therefore, based on its idea, I create this new armory mod.  

## Improvement  
1. Fix bug in Inky's Armory Mod. Now it works under V2.2
2. Update weapons. Now it provide weapons of all 3 DLCs (Rise of the Giant, Fatal Falls, The Bad Seed).  
3. Add a python script to get weapon list and create the room file automatically.
